                <h3>When is the best time to shave?</h3>
                <p>
                    Shaving in the shower is the best place for the cleanest, closest shave. The steam from the shower softens the beard hairs and helps them to stand up straighter. This is a great way to help avoid ingrown hairs and razor burn.

                <h3>Are Anthony products tested on animals?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. Anthony Brands is against animal testing and we strive to work with partners who share the same philosophy.

                <p>
                    Non-comedegenic refers to whether the product can be used by a variety of skin types and the fact that it does not clog pores. Actually, all Anthony products go a step further and meet an even higher standard and are completely allergy and dermatology tested.

                <h3>In what order should I use my Anthony products?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Anthony line is based on a three easy steps: Cleanse, Tone, and Hydrate. To get the best results, incorporate these three steps into your daily routine. Thorou-ghly cleanse before you shave to prep the skin and beard for the closest shave po-ssible without redness and irritation. Tone and hydrate after shaving to calm the skin and keep your complexion clear.

                <h3>Can I use Anthony products daily?</h3>

                <h3>What exactly is the "T-zone" and how do I control it?</h3>
                <p>
                    The term “T-zone” refers to the central part of a person&#39;s face, including the fore-head, nose, and chin. This tends to be the part of a man’s face that secretes the most oil. It is beneficial to understand that this zone requires special attention, using the appropriate cleanser and toner to control excess oil and remove shine.

                <h3>What's the difference between Glycolic and Algae Facial Cleanser?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our two cleansing choices are completely different, as they are designed for different skin types and different seasons/climate conditions. Our Glycolic Facial Cleanser is designed for normal to oily skin types to control oil, breakouts, and shine. It is highly effective at controlling excess dirt, sweat and oil, which accumula-tes more rapidly during the warmer months. Our Algae Facial Cleanser is designed for normal to dry/sensitive or sun-damaged skin. It hydrates and conditions as it cleanses. It is more conditioning and protective during the colder months when skinis exposed to harsh temperatures and dry heated interiors.

                <h3>How do I use Scrub? Can it be used in placed of a cleanser?</h3>
                <p>
                    Gently apply a scrub in circular motions on the skin 2-3 times a week, concentrati-ng on the “T Zone” and beard areas. Rinse with lukewarm water. A scrub is design-ed to be used in addition to a cleanser 2-3 times a week. Wash your face daily with the appropriate cleanser for your skin type; add an exfoliant to remove dead skin cells, dirt, and oil.

                <h3>What is the difference between Anthony Shave Cream and Shave Gel?</h3>
                <p>
                    These formulas are designed for different beard and skin types. The Shave Cream is a rich, whipped formula designed to protect the skin and soften medium to thick beards, is ideal for shaving heads, and can be used by women for their legs with incredible results. The Shave Gel contains no detergents and is a rich, clear gel containing unique moisturizing beads to protect super sensitive skin and younger, thinner beards. It is specifically designed to protect the skin, with concentrated hydrating ingredients to create glide, not drag, on sensitive skin. It is ideal for wo-men to use under the arms, on legs and in the bikini zone. It’s also great for a head shave.

                <h3>What's the purpose of Pre-Shave + Conditioning Beard Oil? Do I really need it?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our Pre-Shave + Conditioning Beard Oil is specifically used to combat problems that many men/women encounter when it comes to shaving, especially if you have sensitive skin. It is applied to clean, wet skin to protect it from the blade. Many people encounter redness, irritation, razor burn, and ingrown hairs from improper shaving. A pre-shave oil puts a layer of protection onto the skin, protecting it fromthe blade and softening coarse beard/body hair. It also has specific ingredients to naturally “lift” hairs for the closest shave possible and to prevent ingrown hairs before they develop.

                <h3>How do I prevent razor burn?</h3>
                <p>
                    Stop the problem before it even begins. Using a Pre-Shave Oil will put that much-needed layer of protection onto the skin before shaving to prevent redness and irritation from the blade. This is likely to happen if you have sensitive skin. Follow up with a soothing after shave balm or treatment product to instantly calm skin, reduce redness and sting, and begin healing. We recommend using our Ingrown Hair Treatment to remedy this situation.

                <h3>What is an ingrown hair?</h3>
                <p>
                    Ingrown hairs (Pseudofolliculitis barbae) are caused by a condition where hair curls back or grows sideways into the skin. Shaving is the leading cause, followed by waxing and tight clothing. This is usually characteristic of individuals who have curly, coarse hairs. This condition may be accompanied by an infection of the hair follicle causing small “razor bumps,” which vary in size. The beginning of an ingro-wn hair begins with a small bump as hair first starts to grow inward and becomes infected. Most commonly, ingrown hairs appear in areas where the skin is shaved or waxed such as the beard, legs and bikini zone. Anything which causes the hair tobe broken off unevenly with a sharp tip can cause ingrown hairs.

                <h3>How long do Anthony products last after opening?</h3>
                <p>
                    All products have PAO symbol with a number on it that indicates how long they are good to use after opening. For example, if the number says 24, the product is good to use for 24 months after opening.
